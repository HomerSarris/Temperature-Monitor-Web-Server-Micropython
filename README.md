# Temperature-Monitor-Web-Server-Micropython
Temperature Monitor in a Web Server Using MicroPython.

This project was developed as part of the Microprocessing Labs (MicroLab) bonus exercises at the National Technical University of Athens, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

# Project Overview
The Temperature Monitor Web Server utilizes a NodeMcu microprocessor connected to a DS18B20 temperature sensor. The purpose is to measure the temperature within the vicinity of the circuit and transmit these measurements to a hosted web server generated by the microprocessor. Additionally, the program stores the measured temperatures in a JSON file on the NodeMcu. The website interface reads this file to display the measurement history, calculates the average temperature of all measurements, and displays the current date and time along with the maximum temperature measured.

Furthermore, the website includes two buttons:

-Fetch Temps: This button refreshes the website to obtain a new temperature measurement.
-Submit: This button submits the current temperature to the history log page and redirects the user to that page.
